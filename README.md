# 🤖 Machine Learning Models Collection

A curated collection of machine learning models that I have trained, analyzed, and documented.
This repository serves as a portfolio of my ML experiments, covering **data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, model training, evaluation, and insights**.

---

## 🧠 About This Repository

This repo contains multiple ML notebooks and datasets that demonstrate:

* 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* 🧹 Data preprocessing & feature engineering
* 🤖 Training supervised & unsupervised ML models
* ⚙️ Hyperparameter tuning & evaluation
* 📈 Comparison of metrics and model performance
* 📁 Clean, reproducible Jupyter notebooks

Each project highlights a specific ML task (classification, regression, clustering, etc.) and includes step-by-step explanations.

## 🏁 Getting Started

1. Clone the repo:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git
   ```
2. Create a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   ```
3. Install dependencies (add your own list or use `requirements.txt` if included):

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Open the notebooks:

   ```bash
   jupyter lab
   ```

---

## 📈 Example Workflows

All notebooks follow a similar workflow:

1. 📥 Load and inspect the dataset
2. 🔍 Perform EDA (visualizations, outliers, distributions)
3. 🧹 Clean & preprocess the data
4. 🤖 Train and evaluate ML models
5. 📊 Compare model performance
6. 💾 Save trained models (optional)
